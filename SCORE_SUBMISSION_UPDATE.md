# Score Submission Update - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement the new score submission requirements:

1. **Remove overwrite popup**: When a score already exists for a player/game combination, the "overwrite" confirmation popup should not be shown.
2. **Disable submit option**: Instead, the submit option for that game/player combination should be removed (disabled or hidden) if a score already exists.
3. **Add confirmation popup**: When submitting any score, a confirmation popup should be created to ask for confirmation before the score is sent to the backend.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`app.py`)

#### New Endpoint Added
- **`/check_existing_score`** (POST): New endpoint to check if a score already exists for a player/game combination
  - Accepts: `{ game: string, player_id: number }`
  - Returns: `{ success: boolean, exists: boolean, game: string, player_id: number }`
  - Handles all game types:
    - `touwspringen`: Checks if player has a score
    - `stoelendans`: Checks if any ordering exists (single result for all players)
    - `rebus`/`wiskunde`: Checks if player has a result
    - `petanque`/`kubb`: Checks if player has participated in any completed matches

### Frontend Changes (`static/script.js`)

#### New Functions Added
1. **`showConfirmationPopup(message)`**: Creates a confirmation popup before score submission
   - Returns a Promise<boolean> (true if confirmed, false if cancelled)
   - Uses the same modal styling as existing popups

2. **`checkExistingScoreAndDisableSubmit()`**: Checks for existing scores and disables submit button accordingly
   - Calls the new backend endpoint `/check_existing_score`
   - Disables submit button and changes text to "Score al ingevoerd" if score exists
   - Handles different game types appropriately
   - Shows appropriate tooltips

#### Modified Functions
1. **`submitScore()`**: 
   - Added confirmation popup call before submission
   - Removed overwrite popup logic (lines 2025-2035)
   - Added call to `checkExistingScoreAndDisableSubmit()` after successful submission

2. **`submitTournamentMatch()`**:
   - Added call to `checkExistingScoreAndDisableSubmit()` after successful submission

#### Event Listeners Modified
1. **Game selection**: Added call to `checkExistingScoreAndDisableSubmit()` when game changes
2. **Player selection** (`tsPlayer`): Added call to `checkExistingScoreAndDisableSubmit()` when player changes
3. **Player selection** (`bwPlayer` for both rebus and wiskunde): Added call to `checkExistingScoreAndDisableSubmit()` when player changes
4. **Initial load**: Added call to `checkExistingScoreAndDisableSubmit()` when page loads

## User Experience Changes

### Before
- User could submit scores multiple times for the same player/game
- Overwrite popup appeared asking "Wil je de score overschrijven?"
- No confirmation before score submission

### After
- Submit button is disabled and shows "Score al ingevoerd" when a score already exists
- Confirmation popup appears before every score submission asking "Weet je zeker dat je deze score wilt invoeren?"
- No overwrite popup shown
- Clear visual feedback about existing scores

## Technical Implementation Details

### Submit Button States
- **Normal**: "Score Invoeren" (enabled)
- **No player selected**: "Score Invoeren" (disabled, tooltip: "Selecteer eerst een speler")
- **Score exists**: "Score al ingevoerd" (disabled, tooltip: "Er is al een score ingevoerd voor deze speler")

### API Integration
- Frontend calls `/check_existing_score` whenever:
  - Game selection changes
  - Player selection changes
  - Page loads initially
  - After successful score submission

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if API calls fail
- Console logging for debugging
- No impact on existing functionality if new features fail

## Testing

### Test File Created
- `test_score_submission.html`: Standalone test file to verify functionality
- Tests confirmation popup, disabled submit button, and backend API
- Can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000/test_score_submission.html`

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the application: `python app.py`
2. Navigate to the main application
3. Select a game and player
4. Verify submit button state changes appropriately
5. Try submitting a score and verify confirmation popup appears
6. Submit a score and verify button becomes disabled
7. Test with different games and players

## Files Modified
- `app.py`: Added new endpoint
- `static/script.js`: Added new functions and modified existing ones
- `test_score_submission.html`: Created for testing (new file)
- `SCORE_SUBMISSION_UPDATE.md`: This summary document (new file)

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes to existing API endpoints
- Existing data structures unchanged
- Gradual rollout - new features are additive

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding visual indicators for which players have scores in which games
- Could add a "view existing scores" feature
- Might want to add admin override for score modifications
- Consider adding score history/audit trail
