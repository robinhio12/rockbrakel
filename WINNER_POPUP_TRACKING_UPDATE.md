# Winner Popup Tracking Update

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Winner popups were being shown multiple times even after being dismissed
**Root Cause**: The frontend was using a local `openWinnerPopups` tracking that only tracked currently open popups, not dismissed ones
**Solution**: Implemented proper backend-based dismissed winners tracking

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`app.py`)

1. **Persistent Storage**: Added dismissed winners to the data loading/saving system
   - Added `dismissed_winners.json` file storage
   - Updated `load_data()` and `save_data()` functions
   - Dismissed winners are now persisted across server restarts

2. **Enhanced Dismiss Endpoint**: Updated `/dismiss_winner` endpoint
   - Now properly loads and saves data
   - Dismissed winners are stored persistently

3. **Added Clear Function**: Added `/clear_dismissed_winners` endpoint
   - For testing and debugging purposes
   - Allows clearing all dismissed winners

### Frontend Changes (`static/script.js`)

1. **Updated Winner Checking**: Replaced local logic with backend calls
   - `checkForNewWinners()` now calls `/check_winners` endpoint
   - Backend handles dismissed winners filtering
   - Frontend only shows popups returned by backend

2. **Enhanced Popup Dismissal**: Updated `showWinnerPopup()` function
   - When popup is closed, calls `/dismiss_winner` endpoint
   - Backend marks winner as dismissed and saves to file
   - Popup won't show again until dismissed winners are cleared

3. **Removed Local Tracking**: Removed `openWinnerPopups` tracking
   - Replaced with backend-based system
   - More reliable and persistent

## How It Works

### Winner Detection Flow
1. Frontend calls `/check_winners` endpoint
2. Backend checks all categories for winners
3. Backend filters out dismissed winners
4. Backend returns only non-dismissed winners
5. Frontend shows popups for returned winners

### Popup Dismissal Flow
1. User closes winner popup (X button, "Gefeliciteerd!" button, or auto-close)
2. Frontend calls `/dismiss_winner` endpoint with category
3. Backend adds category to dismissed_winners set
4. Backend saves dismissed_winners to file
5. Popup won't show again for that category

### Data Persistence
- Dismissed winners are stored in `data/dismissed_winners.json`
- Data persists across server restarts
- Can be cleared for testing using `/clear_dismissed_winners`

## Testing

### Debug Functions Available
- `window.clearPopupSession()` - Clears all dismissed winners
- `window.forceCheckWinners()` - Forces winner check
- `window.testWinnerPopup()` - Shows test popup

### Test Scenarios
1. **First Time**: Winner popup shows when all scores are entered
2. **After Dismissal**: Popup doesn't show again for same category
3. **Server Restart**: Dismissed winners remain dismissed
4. **Clear and Retest**: After clearing, popups show again

## Files Modified

1. **`app.py`**:
   - Added dismissed_winners to load_data/save_data
   - Enhanced dismiss_winner endpoint
   - Added clear_dismissed_winners endpoint

2. **`static/script.js`**:
   - Updated checkForNewWinners to use backend
   - Enhanced showWinnerPopup to call dismiss endpoint
   - Removed local openWinnerPopups tracking
   - Updated debug functions

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Existing winner detection logic is preserved
- Only the tracking mechanism has been improved
- No breaking changes to the user interface

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Popups only show once per category
2. **Persistence**: Dismissed state survives server restarts
3. **Consistency**: Backend handles all winner logic
4. **Debugging**: Easy to clear and retest
5. **User Experience**: No more annoying repeated popups
