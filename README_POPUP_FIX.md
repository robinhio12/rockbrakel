# Winner Popup Fix

## Problem
Only the first winner popup was being shown, and subsequent popups for other jersey types were not appearing even when their criteria were met.

## Root Cause
The original code had two issues:

1. **Session Storage Logic**: Used `sessionStorage` to track which popups had been shown, preventing them from showing again even after being closed.

2. **Overly Restrictive Conditions**: The popup showing logic was too restrictive, preventing multiple different jersey popups from showing simultaneously.

## Solution
Modified the `checkForNewWinners` function in `static/script.js`:

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Session Storage Tracking**: 
   - Removed `shownPopups` logic that prevented popups from showing again
   - Now only uses `openWinnerPopups` Set to track currently open popups

2. **Simplified Popup Conditions**:
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   if (allScoresEntered && 
       !shownPopups[popupKey] && 
       !openWinnerPopups.has(jerseyKey)) {
   
   // After:
   if (allScoresEntered && 
       !openWinnerPopups.has(jerseyKey)) {
   ```

3. **Maintained Proper Cleanup**: 
   - Popups are still properly removed from tracking when closed
   - Each jersey type can show its popup independently
   - No duplicate popups of the same jersey type

## How It Works Now

1. **Multiple Popups**: Different jersey types (Gele Trui, Groene Trui, Bolletjestrui, Witte Trui) can show their popups simultaneously when their criteria are met.

2. **No Duplicates**: The same jersey popup won't show multiple times while it's already open.

3. **Proper Cleanup**: When a popup is closed (manually or automatically), it's removed from tracking, allowing it to show again if needed.

4. **Independent Tracking**: Each jersey type is tracked independently, so closing one popup doesn't affect others.

## Testing

Use the test files to verify the fix:

- `test_multiple_popups.html` - Test multiple popups showing simultaneously
- `test_popup.html` - Basic popup functionality test
- `test_groene_trui_popup.html` - Comprehensive popup testing

## Debug Functions

The following debug functions are available in the browser console:

- `clearPopupSession()` - Clear all popup tracking
- `testAllPopups()` - Test all jersey popups
- `forceCheckWinners()` - Force check for new winners
- `testScoreChecking()` - Debug score checking logic

## Files Modified

- `static/script.js` - Main popup logic changes
